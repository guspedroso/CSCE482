	//The audio filename (mp3/ogg, restricted to beatmap directory).
AudioHash:
	//???
AudioLeadIn: 0
	//The number of ms to allow before mp3 starts.  Basically starts the internal time counter at a negative position.
PreviewTime: -1
	//The position in the song (ms) to play the song selection preview from.
Countdown: 1
	//Type of countdown {Disabled = 0, Normal = 1, HalfSpeed = 2, DoubleSpeed = 3}
SampleSet: Normal
	//Audio sampleset name.  Either Normal or Soft at the moment.  This is the map default and is overridden by TimingPoints.

[TimingPoints]
4056,461.551275,4,1,1,100
	//offsetMs,beatLength,timingSignature,sampleSetId,useCustomSamples,sampleVolume
	//offsetMs   - the offset in milliseconds for this section
	//beatLength - length of a single beat in milliseconds (double accuracy)
	//timingSignature - 3 = simple triple, 4 = simple quadruple.  Used in editor.
	//sampleSetId - timing point specific samples {None = 0, Normal = 1, Soft = 2}
	//useCustomSamples - use skin localised samples? {No = 0, Yes = 1}
	//sampleVolume - volume of the samples
	//timingChange - is there a timing change (beatLength)? {No = 0, Yes = 1}
	//kiaiTimeActive - is kiai time active? {No = 0, Yes = 1}
[Colours]
Combo1 : 209,209,209
	//RGB values
Combo2 : 61,27,222
Combo3 : 63,63,63
Combo4 : 234,119,15
	//Up to five entries for combo colours.  When not present, default four colours are used (see skintemplate).

[HitObjects]
	//HitObjectSoundType {Normal = 0, Whistle = 2, Finish = 4, WhistleFinish = 6, Clap = 8}
	// For a hit circle: x,y,startTime,objectType,soundType
	// For a slider: x,y,startTime,objectType,soundType,curveType|x1,y1|x2,y2|...xn,yn,repeatCount,pixelLength
	// For a spinner: x,y,startTime,objectType,soundType,endTime

	//Bitwise flag enums:
	//HitObjectType {Normal = 1, Slider = 2, NewCombo = 4, NormalNewCombo = 5, SliderNewCombo = 6, Spinner = 8}
	//HitObjectSoundType {Normal = 0, Whistle = 2, Finish = 4, WhistleFinish = 6}
	
	//SliderCurveType { C = Catmull, B = Bezier, L = Linear }
	//See http://up.ppy.sh/files/sliderstuff.cs and http://pe.ppy.sh/bezier.cs for curve creation specifics.
	//Post if you need more slider creation help.
